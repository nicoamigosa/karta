# Karta visual identity v1

Signed off on 2026-09-25 by the founder and the designer (#15). Values live in
[`tokens.json`](tokens.json); this page explains how they fit together. The
interactive reference (all rounds plus the deck prototype, page *Final · deck*)
is the design canvas linked from #15. Product context: `CONTEXT.md` → **Card**,
**Course**; ADR 0012 and 0013.

## Concept

*karta* is a card of a deck **and** *à la carte*. Each recipe is a Card; the
Feed is a vertical deck you pass one card at a time. Warm, homey and tactile,
never neon or TikTok-loud. **Light mode only.**

## Colour

- **Paper** `#F3EBDD` is the screen background. **Card** `#FFFAF0` is the face
  of every card.
- **All text is oxblood** `ink #4E1A12`: time, suit label, title, buttons.
  `inkMuted #7A4A3C` only for secondary hints.
- **The wordmark is the only brand-coloured text** (`brand #A5432D`).
- Colour otherwise comes from the **suit** (the recipe's primary Course): the
  back of the card and the chips. Each suit has four tones: `back`, `edge`,
  `chip`, `chipInk`.

## Type

Two families, both OFL, bundled in the app: **Fraunces** (display, `SOFT` axis
at 100) and **Figtree** (UI). Card roles: `rank` (the minutes), `rankUnit`
("MIN"), `suitLabel` (the Course, lowercase italic), `cardTitle`, `chip`.

## The Card

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐  radius 26, face #FFFAF0
│ 35 MIN                 dinner │  rank + rankUnit · suitLabel (no icon)
│ ┌───────────────────────────┐ │
│ │                           │ │  photo, radius 18, inset 12,
│ │          photo            │ │  grows to fill the free height
│ │                           │ │
│ └───────────────────────────┘ │
│  Spanish Tortilla             │  cardTitle
│  [Serves 4] [Easy]            │  chips tinted by the suit
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

- Always exactly: time, servings, difficulty, primary Course. No tags, no diet,
  no Save button (ADR 0012/0013).
- **Relief:** the card has a visible 4 px edge (four 1 px layers, `cardEdge`)
  plus a soft drop shadow. The cards behind get the same edge in their suit's
  `edge` tone.
- The photo sits **inset** in the card (rounded, 12 pt margin), not edge to
  edge. The photo stretches; the text block stays tight below it.

## The deck

- Two cards peek behind the front one, fanned (`deck.back1`, `deck.back2`).
  Each shows its **back**: a flat card in its own suit colour with a thin
  cream inner frame, so the upcoming suits are visible at a glance.
- **Next:** the front card lifts up and away (`deck.leaving`), `back1`
  straightens into the front slot and turns face up (face fades in after
  120 ms), `back2` moves to `back1`, and the following card slides in as the
  new `back2`. **Previous** plays it in reverse. 460 ms, curve
  `(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`; a vertical swipe past 40 pt commits.
- **Entry nudge (teaches the gesture, no overlay):** when the deck first
  appears, the front card lifts slightly (`deck.entryNudge`), shows the card
  beneath and settles back, twice, then stops; it stops at once on the first
  touch. Under the deck a hint ("Swipe up or down") fades out after 3 s. There
  is no tutorial pop-up.
- **Reduce Motion:** replace the movement with a cross-fade and skip the nudge.
- **Vertical axis.** Horizontal swipes are reserved for moving between steps in
  the cooking session. A usability test (#86) may revisit this later.
- A card counts as a **Vista** only once it has settled in the front slot.

## The reverse (recipe detail)

Tapping a Card flips it over and grows it into the reverse (the Apertura).

```

- **Ingredients** are named with the exact variety to buy (`Yellow onion`).
- **Steps** show the editor's one-line summary; the full step text lives in
  the cooking session. **Optional steps are not listed here**; they appear
  only in the cooking session.
- For a user with an intolerance, an optional ingredient containing that
  allergen (and its optional step) is not shown anywhere (`CONTEXT.md` →
  Ingrediente opcional).
- **Save** lives only here, never on the front of the Card.

Layout rules (reference: canvas board *Reverse A centered · course on top*):

- **One ingredient, one line.** Name (Figtree 700, `ink`) · dotted leader ·
  quantity (Figtree 500, `inkMuted`), all 15 pt and on one baseline; the row
  never wraps. The quantity keeps its full width, the leader absorbs the slack
  and, only as a last resort, the name truncates with `…`. Every quantity ends
  on the same right edge.
- **Step labels flow inline.** The timer (`12 min`) and `clip` labels follow
  the last word of the step like another word: on the same line when they
  fit, otherwise at the start of the next line; never forced onto a line of
  their own under the text. Chip text 12 pt, weight 800, suit `chip` /
  `chipInk`, radius 8.
- Step text is 15 pt on a 22 pt line, left-aligned on a common edge after the
  number disc.
- **✕ and Save are tactile buttons**, never bare text or icons: 40 pt high,
  fill `card`, 1 pt border `line`, 2 pt solid bottom edge `buttonEdge`. ✕ is
  a circle (14 pt cross, stroke 2); Save is a pill with 14 pt side padding,
  a 16 pt stroke icon, 6 pt gap and the `button` type. Saved and
  cap-blocked states keep the same shape.
- **Start cooking** is the one filled button: `brand` fill, 54 pt high,
  radius 18, label plus 18 pt arrow (gap 10) in Figtree 800 17 pt `card`,
  3 pt solid bottom edge `brandEdge` plus a soft drop shadow.

## Suits (Course icons)

`suits/breakfast.svg` (fried egg), `suits/lunch.svg` (half sandwich),
`suits/dinner.svg` (cloche), `suits/dessert.svg` (cupcake). They are **not**
shown on the Card (the suit there is the italic label); they are used in
filters, the recipe detail and empty states. 24 × 24 viewBox, flat colour.

## App icon and wordmark

- **Icon** (`app-icon.svg`): three cards fanned on paper `#F3EBDD`, sage,
  mustard and a front card in `card` with a Fraunces 900 "k" in `brand`.
  Export at 1024 × 1024 without transparency; the "k" must be converted to
  outlines on export.
- **Wordmark:** "karta", lowercase, Fraunces 900 `SOFT` 100, tracking −0.8
  at 30 pt, in `brand`.
